Classification = a machine learning model used for distinguishing among two or more output categories

Cross-Entropy = loss function to measure the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the true distribution

Dense layer = a linear operation in which every input is connected to every output by a weight

Flattening = converting 2d image to 1d vector

Loss function = it measures the difference between the prediction and the actual output

Overfitting = when a model gets trained with so much data, it starts learning from the noise and inaccurate data entries

ReLU = an activation function that allows a model to solve nonlinear problems

Softmax = a function that provides probabilities for each possible output class

Tensor = a tensor is a multidimensional array that represents the data in a machine learning model
