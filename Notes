1 Neural Networks
It consists of layers of interconnected nodes.
Each node receives input, processes it and passes to the next layer.

Layers: there are 3 types of layers in neural network
- Input Layer: the initial layer where data enters the network
- Hidden Layers: intermediate layers where the actual processing is done. The term "deep" in Deep Learning refers to the use of multiple hidden layers.
- Output Layer: the final layer where the output is produced
