1 Neural Networks
It consists of layers of interconnected nodes.
Each node receives input, processes it and passes to the next layer.

Layers: there are 3 types of layers in neural network
- Input Layer: the initial layer where data enters the network
- Hidden Layers: intermediate layers where the actual processing is done. The term "deep" in Deep Learning refers to the use of multiple hidden layers.
- Output Layer: the final layer where the output is produced

2 Activation Functions
These functions introduce non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn more complex patterns.
Common activation functions include ReLU, Sigmoid and Tanh.

3 Training
- Forward Propagation: data passes through the network, and predictions are made.
- Loss Function: measures how far the predictions are from the actual results.
- Backpropagation: the error is sent back through the network, adjusting the weights to minimize the loss.

4 Optimization Algorithms
Algorithms like Gradient Descent are used to update the weights and minimize the loss.
